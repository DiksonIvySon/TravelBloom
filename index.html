                        <h4><b>Boulders Beach</b></h4>
                        <p>Boulders Beach in False Bay is a busy place… humans flock here to see the large colony of African Penguins. 
                            Of course, the white sand and shallow, clear (cold) waters don't hurt the eyes either. The penguins do hurt 
                            the nose, however, as they do come with a scent.

                            Know that the penguins are kings of this beach, and you, the peasant, are only allowed on the wooden boardwalk 
                            and not on the sand in the main area (other bloggers tend to make it seem like you are free to wander among them 
                            and that's just not true). You also pay a fee of around ZAR 180 to go onto the boardwalk, usually with another 
                            gazillion people at the same time, so don't expect tranquility.

                        <h4><b>Nordhoek Beach</b></h4>
                        <p>Nordhoek Beach is best appreciated from Chapman's Peak on the north end. That's when you see the long, wide,
                             perfectly stretch of white sand and unbelievably clear/turquoise waters of the Atlantic from above. It's almost 
                             unbelievable that this little slice of natural perfection is so close Cape Town, a metropolitan area of 5 million 
                             people. At Nordhoek, backed only by distant residences, you'll believe you've escaped the city by a long run.

                            Large boulders and pretty mountains on each end of Nordhoek give a great backdrop, and props also go to the Atlantic 
                            Ocean that somehow manages to give off just the right amount of mist to add to atmosphere. I didn't meet a lot of 
                            people there, but if you do, you'll almost certainly see them riding horses or at least walking dogs.

                            Madhya Kailash temple in Midrand is a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva of the Hindu mythology, who is supposed to
                            be the destroyer of all the evils of this world. The temple follows the Shaivism sect of Hinduism, a sect which 
                            believes that the Supreme Power Lord Shiva is faceless, timeless and spaceless.
